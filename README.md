# The-Coder-s-Cove
#### Most coding training portray as a magic bullet that will turn you into an instant coder. Students expect that they can become a code pro just by completing a tutorial or two, but then realize that they’re not getting anywhere. This mini project, The Coder’s Cove is a self directed commitment.

### OBEJECTIVES:

* The main objective is to increase the programming ability of the programmer
which would help them to crack coding interviews.
* To provide a all-in-one platform for the coders, which includes to-do list, sticky
notes, writing board, clock, timer, language learning platform, online compliers,
practice coding and get motivation.
* To provide a stress buster module that promotes mental heath care to boost
confidence.
